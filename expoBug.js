This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has issues related to its configuration or dependencies.  It often manifests without a clear, specific error message, leaving developers puzzled. One common cause is an incompatibility between the project's dependencies (e.g., React Native, Expo modules) and the currently installed Expo CLI version. Another potential cause stems from incorrect configurations in files like `package.json`, `app.json`, or `eas.json`.  Improperly configured build environments or missing native modules can also trigger this problem. Debugging usually involves checking the package.json for mismatched dependency versions, ensuring correct app.json and eas.json configurations (especially Android and iOS platform configurations). Thorough checks for missing or improperly linked native modules, and trying to clean the project and reinstall dependencies can resolve the issue.
