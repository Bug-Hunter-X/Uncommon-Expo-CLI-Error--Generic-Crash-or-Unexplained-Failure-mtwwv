The solution typically involves a multi-step diagnostic process:

1. **Check `package.json` for dependency conflicts:** Carefully review your `package.json` file, paying close attention to the versions of `expo`, `react-native`, and any other third-party libraries. Look for discrepancies or known incompatibilities between versions.

2. **Verify `app.json` and `eas.json` configurations:** Thoroughly check `app.json` for correct configurations like the project name, version, and platform-specific settings. Review `eas.json` for any build-related configurations, especially if you're using EAS Build.

3. **Clean the project and reinstall dependencies:** Use the following command to clean your project's build files and node modules before reinstalling dependencies:

```bash
expo prebuild --clean
expo install
```

4. **Examine native module links (if applicable):** If your project uses native modules, make sure they are correctly linked and configured for both Android and iOS.

5. **Rebuild the project:** After cleaning and reinstalling dependencies, attempt to build the project again.

6. **If the problem persists:** Create a fresh Expo project to rule out any corruption in your current project directory. Then, gradually transfer code to the new project, testing after each segment to isolate the source of the error.

**Example (package.json):**
```json
{
  "name": "my-expo-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^47.0.12",
    "react-native": "~0.71.8", 
    // ... other dependencies
  }
}
```

By systematically checking these areas, you can often identify and resolve the underlying cause of this frustrating but common Expo CLI error.
